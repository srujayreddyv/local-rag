    "\n",
    "There are frameworks that replicate this kind of workflow, including [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) and [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), however, the goal of building from scratch is to be able to inspect and customize all the parts."

    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was introduced in the paper [*Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step can be roughly broken down to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieval** - Seeking relevant information from a source given a query. For example, getting relevant passages of Wikipedia text from a database given a question.\n",
    "* **Augmented** - Using the relevant retrieved information to modify an input to a generative model (e.g. an LLM).\n",
    "* **Generation** - Generating an output given an input. For example, in the case of an LLM, generating a passage of text given an input prompt."

    "## Why RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outptus of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two primary improvements can be seen as:\n",
    "1. **Preventing hallucinations** - LLMs are incredible but they are prone to potential hallucination, as in, generating something that *looks* correct but isn't. RAG pipelines can help LLMs generate more factual outputs by providing them with factual (retrieved) inputs. And even if the generated answer from a RAG pipeline doesn't seem correct, because of retrieval, you also have access to the sources where it came from.\n",
    "2. **Work with custom data** - Many base LLMs are trained with internet-scale text data. This means they have a great ability to model language, however, they often lack specific knowledge. RAG systems can provide LLMs with domain-specific data such as medical information or company documentation and thus customized their outputs to suit specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the original RAG paper mentioned above outlined these two points in their discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This work offers several positive societal benefits over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",
    "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
    "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
    "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society, for example by endowing it\n",
    "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
    "effective at their jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG can also be a much quicker solution to implement than fine-tuning an LLM on specific data. \n"

    "## What kind of problems can RAG be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG can help anywhere there is a specific set of information that an LLM may not have in its training data (e.g. anything not publicly accessible on the internet).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you could use RAG for:\n",
    "* **Customer support Q&A chat** - By treating your existing customer support documentation as a resource, when a customer asks a question, you could have a system retrieve relevant documentation snippets and then have an LLM craft those snippets into an answer. Think of this as a \"chatbot for your documentation\". Klarna, a large financial company, [uses a system like this](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/) to save $40M per year on customer support costs.\n",
    "* **Email chain analysis** - Let's say you're an insurance company with long threads of emails between customers and insurance agents. Instead of searching through each individual email, you could retrieve relevant passages and have an LLM create strucutred outputs of insurance claims.\n",
    "* **Company internal documentation chat** - If you've worked at a large company, you know how hard it can be to get an answer sometimes. Why not let a RAG system index your company information and have an LLM answer questions you may have? The benefit of RAG is that you will have references to resources to learn more if the LLM answer doesn't suffice.\n",
    "* **Textbook Q&A** - Let's say you're studying for your exams and constantly flicking through a large textbook looking for answers to your quesitons. RAG can help provide answers as well as references to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these have the common theme of retrieving relevant resources and then presenting them in an understandable way using an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this angle, you can consider an LLM a calculator for words.\n"

    "\n",
    "Privacy, speed, cost.\n",

    "From a privacy standpoint, this means you don't have send potentially sensitive data to an API.\n",

    "From a speed standpoint, it means you won't necessarily have to wait for an API queue or downtime, if your hardware is running, the pipeline can run.\n",

    "## Key terms\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term | Description |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- | \n",
    "| **Token** | A sub-word piece of text. For example, \"hello, world!\" could be split into [\"hello\", \",\", \"world\", \"!\"]. A token can be a whole word,<br> part of a word or group of punctuation characters. 1 token ~= 4 characters in English, 100 tokens ~= 75 words.<br> Text gets broken into tokens before being passed to an LLM. |\n",
    "| **Embedding** | A learned numerical representation of a piece of data. For example, a sentence of text could be represented by a vector with<br> 768 values. Similar pieces of text (in meaning) will ideally have similar values. |\n",
    "| **Embedding model** | A model designed to accept input data and output a numerical representation. For example, a text embedding model may take in 384 <br>tokens of text and turn it into a vector of size 768. An embedding model can and often is different to an LLM model. |\n",
    "| **Similarity search/vector search** | Similarity search/vector search aims to find two vectors which are close together in high-demensional space. For example, <br>two pieces of similar text passed through an embedding model should have a high similarity score, whereas two pieces of text about<br> different topics will have a lower similarity score. Common similarity score measures are dot product and cosine similarity. |\n",
    "| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | A model which has been trained to numerically represent the patterns in text. A generative LLM will continue a sequence when given a sequence. <br>For example, given a sequence of the text \"hello, world!\", a genertive LLM may produce \"we're going to build a RAG pipeline today!\".<br> This generation will be highly dependant on the training data and prompt. |\n",
    "| **LLM context window** | The number of tokens a LLM can accept as input. For example, as of March 2024, GPT-4 has a default context window of 32k tokens<br> (about 96 pages of text) but can go up to 128k if needed. A recent open-source LLM from Google, Gemma (March 2024) has a context<br> window of 8,192 tokens (about 24 pages of text). A higher context window means an LLM can accept more relevant information<br> to assist with a query. For example, in a RAG pipeline, if a model has a larger context window, it can accept more reference items<br> from the retrieval system to aid with its generation. |\n",
    "| **Prompt** | A common term for describing the input to a generative LLM. The idea of \"[prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)\" is to structure a text-based<br> (or potentially image-based as well) input to a generative LLM in a specific way so that the generated output is ideal. This technique is<br> possible because of a LLMs capacity for in-context learning, as in, it is able to use its representation of language to breakdown <br>the prompt and recognize what a suitable output may be (note: the output of LLMs is probable, so terms like \"may output\" are used). | \n"

    "\n",
    "Meaning rather than directly mapping words/tokens/characters to numbers directly (e.g. `{\"a\": 0, \"b\": 1, \"c\": 3...}`), the numerical representation of tokens is learned by going through large corpuses of text and figuring out how different tokens relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, embeddings of text will mean that similar meaning texts have similar numerical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Most modern NLP models deal with \"tokens\" which can be considered as multiple different sizes and combinations of words and characters rather than always whole words or single characters. For example, the string `\"hello world!\"` gets mapped to the token values `{15339: b'hello', 1917: b' world', 0: b'!'}` using [Byte pair encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) (or BPE via OpenAI's [`tiktoken`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) library). Google has a tokenization library called [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want the model to run locally, you'll have to make sure it's feasible to run on your own hardware. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good place to see how different models perform on a wide range of embedding tasks is the [Hugging Face Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What other forms of text chunking/splitting are there?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a fair few options here too. We've kept it simple with groups of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more, [Pinecone has a great guide on different kinds of chunking](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/) including for different kinds of data such as markdown and LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries such as [LangChain also have a good amount of in-built text splitting options](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What should I think about when creating my embeddings?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model turns text inputs up to 384 tokens long in embedding vectors of size 768.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the larger the vector size, the more information that gets encoded into the embedding (however, this is not always the case, as smaller, better models can outperform larger ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though with larger vector sizes comes larger storage and compute requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model is also relatively small (420MB) in size compared to larger models that are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger models may result in better performance but will also require more compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "So some things to think about:\n",
    "* Size of input - If you need to embed longer sequences, choose a model with a larger input capacity.\n",
    "* Size of embedding vector - Larger is generally a better representation but requires more compute/storage.\n",
    "* Size of model - Larger models generally result in better embeddings but require more compute power/time to run.\n",
    "* Open or closed - Open models allow you to run them on your own hardware whereas closed models can be easier to setup but require an API call to get embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Where should I store my embeddings?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've got a relatively small dataset, for example, under 100,000 examples (this number is rough and only based on first hand experience), `np.array` or `torch.tensor` can work just fine as your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you've got a production system and want to work with 100,000+ embeddings, you may want to look into a [vector database]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_database) (these have become very popular lately and there are many offerings).\n",

    "## 2. RAG - Search and Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed RAG briefly in the beginning but let's quickly recap.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is another way of saying \"given a query, search for relevant resources and answer based on those resources\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's breakdown each step:\n",
    "* **Retrieval** - Get relevant resources given a query. For example, if the query is \"what are the macronutrients?\" the ideal results will contain information about protein, carbohydrates and fats (and possibly alcohol) rather than information about which tractors are the best for farming (though that is also cool information).\n",
    "* **Augmentation** - LLMs are capable of generating text given a prompt. However, this generated text is designed to *look* right. And it often has some correct information, however, they are prone to hallucination (generating a result that *looks* like legit text but is factually wrong). In augmentation, we pass relevant information into the prompt and get an LLM to use that relevant information as the basis of its generation.\n",
    "* **Generation** - This is where the LLM will generate a response that has been flavoured/augmented with the retrieved resources. In turn, this not only gives us a potentially more correct answer, it also gives us resources to investigate more (since we know which resources went into the prompt).\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole idea of RAG is to get an LLM to be more factually correct based on your own input as well as have a reference to where the generated output may have come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an incredibly helpful tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you had 1000s of customer support documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use RAG to generate direct answers to questions with links to relevant documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you were an insurance company with large chains of claims emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use RAG to answer questions about the emails with sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "One helpful analogy is to think of LLMs as calculators for words.\n",
    "\n",
    "With good inputs, the LLM can sort them into helpful outputs.\n",

    "How? \n",

    "Alright! Looks like `gemma-7b-it` it is (for my local machine with an RTX 4090, change the `model_id` and `use_quantization_config` values to suit your needs)! \n",

    "1. A quantization config (optional) - This will determine whether or not we load the model in 4bit precision for lower memory usage. The we can create this with the [`transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.38.2/en/main_classes/quantization#transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig) class (requires installing the [`bitsandbytes` library](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)).\n",
    "2. A model ID - This is the reference Hugging Face model ID which will determine which tokenizer and model gets used. For example `gemma-7b-it`.\n",
    "3. A tokenzier - This is what will turn our raw text into tokens ready for the model. We can create it using the [`transformers.AutoTokenzier.from_pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.38.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer) method and passing it our model ID.\n",
    "4. An LLM model - Again, using our model ID we can load a specific LLM model. To do so we can use the [`transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained) method and passing it our model ID as well as other various parameters.\n",

    "As a bonus, we'll check if [Flash Attention 2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_infer_gpu_one#flashattention-2) is available using `transformers.utils.is_flash_attn_2_available()`. Flash Attention 2 speeds up the attention mechanism in Transformer architecture models (which is what many modern LLMs are based on, including Gemma). So if it's available and the model is supported (not all models support Flash Attention 2), we'll use it. If it's not available, you can install it by following the instructions on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Flash Attention 2 currently works on NVIDIA GPUs with a compute capability score of 8.0+ (Ampere, Ada Lovelace, Hopper architectures). We can check our GPU compute capability score with [`torch.cuda.get_device_capability(0)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cuda.get_device_capability.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** To get access to the Gemma models, you will have to [agree to the terms & conditions](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it) on the Gemma model page on Hugging Face. You will then have to authorize your local machine via the [Hugging Face CLI/Hugging Face Hub `login()` function](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/quick-start#authentication). Once you've done this, you'll be able to download the models. If you're using Google Colab, you can add a [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) to the \"Secrets\" tab.\n",

    "Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
    "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
    "\\nExample 2:\n",
    "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
    "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
    "\\nExample 3:\n",
    "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
    "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",
